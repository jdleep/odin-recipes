        <ul>
            <li>1 pound bulk mild Italian sausage</li>
            <li>1 ¼ teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>5 (13.75 ounce) cans chicken broth</li>
            <li>6 medium potatoes, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/4 bunch fresh spinach, tough stems removed</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a 
                Dutch oven over medium-high heat until crumbly, 
                browned, and no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. 
                Drain and set aside. </li>
            <li>Cook bacon in the same Dutch oven over medium heat 
                until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain, leaving a 
                few tablespoons of drippings with the bacon in the 
                bottom of the Dutch oven. Stir in onions and garlic; 
                cook until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in chicken broth and bring to a boil over high 
                heat. Add potatoes and simmer until fork tender, about 
                20 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; stir in cream, 
                cooked sausage, and spinach. Cook and stir until 
                spinach has wilted and sausage is warmed through; 
                serve. </li>
        </ol>
